# Cramit: Smart Revision

This folder contains 10 screens exported from Screens Design.

## Contents

- `/screens/` - HTML files for each screen (Tailwind CSS)
- `manifest.json` - Screen metadata and file mapping

## How to Use with AI Code Editors

1. Open this folder in your AI-powered code editor (Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, Claude Code, etc.)

2. Ask the AI to build your app using these designs as reference:

   "Build a React/Next.js app based on the screens in /screens. Follow the exact UI design and create appropriate component structure."

3. The AI will analyze the HTML/CSS and create production-ready components.

## Tips

- The HTML uses Tailwind CSS classes - ensure your project has Tailwind configured
- Each screen is self-contained and can be converted to a React component
- Reference specific screens by name when asking for changes
