you are an agent and i am your master.

I am building a startup called cramit.

it is  flash cards app mobile app for jee preparation.

right now i am foucusing on prototyping the frontend of the app.

i have a color scheme and design in mind.
but i have no clear view you have to be creative and give me ideas.


here is some context of what i want to build.

right now i am  just focusing on home and other navigation pages.

ser downloads app:
Opens app
A animated toutorial comes on how to use this feature skipable(optional).

user completes it or skipps it

goes to the login screen
asks for phone number and otp and refferal code(teachers for admin panel if given user -->premium)
2 posiblilites user exists and new user; with 2 possiblilities paid and unpaid;
new user:
    Sees featured decks per subject;(don’t mix the global queue of subjects;)
a library of decks (with search featrue)
brading and streak things motivation.

{now what should be the things
option1 let him select 3 decks;
and then start with predefined amt of flashcards to be scrolled throuugh;
    
    Option 2:he goes and does predfind amt of cards in a featured deck or he searches for one and then in that
if paid all the deck open if not few decks open {or we could do a free trial of 15 days on each phone number}
    
Existing user:
           sees the global queue of each subject the he has to complete.with all that steak and branding


    And few suggested decks he could select too add for review;
    He could click on a deck and review it if he wants too 
there is a nested sturture of decks(physics(he can revise all physics but can open decks under it;
then electrodynamic megnatism;nuclear physics;mechanics(he could revise one whole but can go in inside topics 
to revise and then at the end a one deck with 40-60 cards)with a pyq deck from the topic idk rate this idea or should we use existing sturture of cramit the decks he choose suggested decks will be on the same level of the decks}

I need to somehow deincentiwce the user to choose new decks or to deck revisions if it is not exam time or something and choose the global queue.
cards can be bookmarked
and there is a deck only of bookmarked cards
if user goes into global queue then he will be shown x amt of cards based on his persformance or may be pre taugh to system he will complete them if it end with completing all the cards
there would be a max session limit say 30 and the syetem would have predicted whaat cards would bbe those whne the first card is opeed and when it completes if user wants to continue next session the system will make a new queue of next 30 cards if he leaves mid session then seesion terminates .

there should be some option to the user for completing only forgotten cards

every deck should have concpet revesion and pyq revsionn
idk should the golbal queue have both or only concept?


the user right now can not create edit or delete cards he will be able to in future updates
he can only view bookmark them and mark them knew didn’t knew and tooo easy (soft delete like kq1q2/r*r)
    He could idk lock unlock a deck in order to not get cards from certain deck in golbal queue
a card can have text,latex and image.
a card can be scrolled
a super card is a group of cards of a topic that can't be expapined by a single card(inbreakable topics only)
and rather than each acrd having seprate attributes this whole uni has one attribute.


I want to solve this problem to that student don’t just do ik I don’t know they also try to learn the problem they did not knew is there any thing I can do.


data from server--> decks cards updates suggestions streaks etc and card rates of learning if the user has deteted and n o data in local .

client to sever: data in chuck of 10 or 20 about the cards choosign

update deck automatically if it one of the selcted decks with new cards etc

the app comes with 2-3 downloaded decks and the user has to donwload the rst of them from server 
most data is stored in phone local storagge



with traditional card
add 2 more card types 
mcq and numerical


if a student gives didn’t knew to a traditional card it would show it always in that session atleast once
    
    User can add deck to the syetem or he can revise the deck only too(have to make it somehow less lucarative)


### I AM JUST FOUCIIGN ON DESIGN OF FRONTEND OF HOME AND OTHER NAV PAGES ACT LIKE A EXPERIENCED UI/UX DESIGNER AND TALK WITH ME HOW AND WHAT CAN WE BUILD.
